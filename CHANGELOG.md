### 2.0.0
- Initial build for beta testing
### 2.0.1
- Accepted to VCV Rack Library
### 2.0.2
- LFOs now start from positions at epoch, not all at zero from instantiation
- Added "reset" button and trigger input to reset all LFO's back to zero
- Fixed phase math issue where LFO's would pick up where they left off when disconnected and reconnected. Oops.
