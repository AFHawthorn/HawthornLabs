is a series of modules for VCV Rack.  Ok, well, currently only ONE module, and that module is called...
## Planetary LFOs
A module for VCV Rack that uses the revolutions of the planets in our solar system as a basis for LFO rates.  For the purposes of this module, Pluto is included as a planet.
A trigger output is also provided that sends a +10v pulse every time a revolution is complete (every "year").
- The Speed knob has 6 lights on it:
    - Fully "down", CCW, the LFO's are produced in realtime
    - The second light represents an Earth year in a day (a time compression of 365.25x)
    - Third light: an Earth year in an hour
    - Fourth light: an Earth year in a minute
    - Fifth light: an Earth year in a second
    - Sixth light: an Earth year in a millisecond
